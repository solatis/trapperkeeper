# Security Index

## Overview

This index provides navigation to all security-related documentation across Trapperkeeper. Use this to discover authentication, encryption, and threat mitigation patterns.

Security is addressed through multiple layers including API authentication, data encryption, and TLS configuration.

## Consolidated Documents

### Authentication

Authentication mechanisms protect API access and user management.

**Relevant Documentation:**

- **[Security Hub](../../06-security/README.md)** - Strategic authentication overview and rationale
- **[Authentication (Web UI)](../../06-security/authentication-web-ui.md)** - Cookie-based session authentication
- **[Authentication (Sensor API)](../../06-security/authentication-sensor-api.md)** - HMAC-based API key authentication

### Encryption

Encryption protects data at rest and in transit.

**Relevant Documentation:**

- **[Encryption Strategy](../../06-security/encryption.md)** - Data encryption approach and key management
- **[TLS/HTTPS Strategy](../../06-security/tls-https-strategy.md)** - Transport security configuration

### Threat Mitigation

Threat mitigation handles security vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

**Relevant Documentation:**

- **[Security Hub](../../06-security/README.md)** - Comprehensive threat model and security boundaries
- **[Validation Hub](../../07-validation/README.md)** - Input sanitization and OWASP compliance
