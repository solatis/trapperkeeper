# Minimal Hub Document

## Context

This hub consolidates fragmented documentation across multiple areas. The current fragmentation creates maintenance overhead and inconsistent guidance.

The need for consolidation is clear: developers must navigate multiple documents to understand a single concept. This unified hub addresses these concerns by providing a single strategic overview.

## Decision

We will implement a unified approach with centralized governance.

This document serves as the hub providing strategic overview with cross-references to detailed implementation documents.

### Core Concept 1

Strategic overview of first concept area.

This establishes the foundation for the unified approach.

**Key Points:**
- Essential point about core concept
- Core principle guiding implementation
- Strategic trade-off decision

**Cross-References:**
- spoke1.md: Implementation details

**Example**: Basic usage demonstrating concept.

### Core Concept 2

Strategic overview of second concept area.

**Key Points:**
- Essential point about second concept
- Core principle for this area

**Cross-References:**
- spoke2.md: Detailed implementation

**Example**: Usage example for concept 2.

### Core Concept 3

Strategic overview of third concept area.

**Key Points:**
- Essential point about third concept
- Guiding principle

**Cross-References:**
- spoke3.md: Technical details

**Example**: Demonstration of concept 3.

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for domain
- Reduced navigation complexity
- Consistent terminology

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires maintaining hub-spoke relationships
- Additional abstraction layer
