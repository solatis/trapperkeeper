# [Original Document Title] - Moved

<!--
TEMPLATE GUIDANCE: This template is for redirect stubs when documents are moved or consolidated.
This template should only be used if specific migration needs arise.

## Document Moved

This document has been moved and consolidated into the new documentation structure.

**New Location**: [New Document Name](doc/path/to/new/document.md)

**Reason**: [Brief explanation of why document was moved - e.g., "Consolidated into unified Security Architecture hub", "Split into multiple focused spoke documents", "Renamed for clarity"]

## Summary of Original Content

<!--
GUIDANCE: Provide 1-2 sentences summarizing what the original document covered.
This helps readers confirm they've found the right redirect.
DO NOT provide the full content.
-->

[1-2 sentences describing what the original document covered]

## How to Update References

If you have links to this document, please update them to point to:

- **Primary replacement**: [New Document Name](doc/path/to/new/document.md)
- **Specific sections**: See the new document's table of contents for detailed topics

## Maintenance

**This is a redirect stub only.** Do NOT edit this file with new content. All updates should be made to the new document location listed above.

<!--
USAGE NOTES:

1. Minimal Content: Redirect stubs should be <50 lines total
2. No Implementation Details: Only provide redirection information
3. Not Indexed: Redirect stubs should not appear in search indexes or navigation
4. Automated Generation: Prefer generating from script rather than manual creation

WHEN TO USE:
- Individual document moves (e.g., doc/foo.md -> doc/bar/foo.md)
- Document consolidation (multiple docs merged into one)
- Document splits (one doc becomes multiple spokes)

WHEN NOT REQUIRED:
- Wholesale directory restructuring (e.g., migrating adr/ to doc/ structure)
- Major documentation rewrites where old structure is replaced entirely
- Internal reorganization where no external links exist

For bulk migrations, document the restructuring in git commit messages and
update any cross-references in the new structure. Redirect stubs for every
deleted file would create maintenance burden without providing navigation value.

Creation Script (if needed):
python doc/scripts/create-redirect-stub.py \
  --old-path doc/old/document.md \
  --new-path doc/new/document.md \
  --reason "Consolidated into Architecture hub"

See doc/_meta/tooling/architecture.md for automation details.
