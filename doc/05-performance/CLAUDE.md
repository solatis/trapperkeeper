# Performance Architecture Guide for LLM Agents

## Purpose

Performance optimization strategy including cost models, sampling, batch processing, and sub-millisecond evaluation targets for Go implementation.

## Hub

**`README.md`** - Read when understanding performance philosophy, cost model principles, or optimization strategy overview

## Files

**`cost-model.md`** - Read when implementing rule priority calculation, understanding field type multipliers, or wildcard cost impacts

**`optimization-strategies.md`** - Read when optimizing rule evaluation, implementing field path caching, or understanding Go-specific performance patterns

**`sampling.md`** - Read when implementing probabilistic sampling, understanding sample_rate semantics, or reducing evaluation load

**`batch-processing.md`** - Read when implementing batch event processing, understanding goroutine concurrency patterns, or optimizing throughput
